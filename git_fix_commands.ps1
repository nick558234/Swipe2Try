# Git commands to force the "fix" branch to be the new main branch
# Run these commands in sequence

# 1. Make sure we're on the fix branch
git checkout fix

# 2. Force push the fix branch to override the remote main branch
# This will make the remote main branch identical to your local fix branch
git push origin fix:main -f

# 3. Switch to the main branch locally
git checkout main

# 4. Reset your local main branch to match the remote main (which is now your fix branch)
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# 5. Update other branches if needed
# git branch -f other_branch main

# NOTE: This approach completely replaces main with fix
# Any unique commits that were only on main and not on fix will be lost
